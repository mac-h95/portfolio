## Zones
Each zone should have a unique ambient track that transitions into a combat track using adaptive music methods when the player attacks an enemy or vice versa.

There should also be transitional music from zone to zone, i.e. the music should transition from the grass soundtrack to the water soundtrack via an in between piece of music.

Each boss should also have its own music.
