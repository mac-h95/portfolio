# Health
The health will be stored as teeth, starting the game with 3 teeth. Upon taking a hit the tooth will crumble and fall out of the container, leaving an outline in its place. I have chosen this method over a health bar as it gives the player immediate feedback on how much damage they can take.

# Mirrors
Mirrors are a collectible currency and will be displayed as an integer with an icon next to them. This should be hidden unless you pick up some mirrors or are in a shop. 
> Note: I may consider removing the Mirrors system in favour of a purely discovery based upgrade system.

# Map 
The user will be able to press the <kbd>Select</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbt> button to bring up a map of the game, displaying sections they have previously visited. I considered adding a minmap in the top right akin to Hollow Knight however I prefer the more cinematic views with a very minimal user interface as seen in Ori.
