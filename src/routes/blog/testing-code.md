This is a quick test of code within my markdown blog.

Here is a React code block written in Javascript

```js
import "milligram";
import { CartProvider, useCartState } from "../library/context";

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => (
  <CartProvider>
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </CartProvider>
);

export default MyApp;
```

Here is a quick snippet written in C#

```c#
using UnityEngine;

// This class inherits from PhysicsObject so it gains all of the properties of PhysicsObject.
public class PlayerController : PhysicsObject
{
  PlayerInput controls;
}
```
