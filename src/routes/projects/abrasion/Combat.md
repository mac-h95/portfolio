## Details
Combat should feel rewarding and easy to learn, by limiting the character to just 2 types of attacks it stops the player having to learn all manner of button combinations.

---

## Attacks
_Dens_ will be able to perform two types of attack, a melee attack using his toothbrush and a grappling hook attack which will do a smaller amount of damage and move the enemy closer to him.

---

## Enemies
Enemies should have a variety of ranged and melee attacks, minions should take between 2 and hits to remove from the game dependant on strength and the players items.

Each zone should have 3 classes of enemy:
- Ranged
- Slow and Strong
- Small and Quick

---

## Bosses
Below is a list of each boss and the zone they will be in. Each boss should fit the zone they belong to in some way, i.e. the grass zone one could use honey to create sweets while the lava zone will have a baker making baked goods.

### Grass Zone

An ice cream maker.
