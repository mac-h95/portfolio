## What is a Triad?
- 3 notes played together.

## How to make a triad
- __Root__ note
- __Middle__ note, __3rd__.
- __Top__ note, __5th__.
- Sound different because of the number of __semitones__ between each note.

## 4 Types of Triad
- __Major__ and __Minor__ Triads
	- Major:
		- 4 semitones from __root__ to __middle__.
		- 7 semitones from __root__ to __top__.
	- Minor:
		- 3 semitones from __root__ to __middle__.
		- 7 semitones from __root__ to __top__.
- __Diminished__ & __Augmented__[^1].
	- Diminished:
		- 3 semitones from __root__ to __middle__ note.
		-	6 semitones from __root__ and the __top__ note.
	- Augmented:
		- 4 semitones from __root__ to __middle__.
		- 8 semitones from __root__ to __top__.

[^1]: Diminished notes can sound "scary" and Augmented notes can sound "mysterious".
