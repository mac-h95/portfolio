# Upgrades
In the shop the player should be able to buy upgrades that increase their damage, health and more.

> [!NOTE] Removing the shop?
> I have considered removing the shop in favour of a discovery based upgrade system. I could run both at the same time, kind of like a Zelda game. Allowing the player to purchase health and damage upgrades, yet discovering more ability based upgrades.
