## Technologies

This site was fun to build and gave me a good understanding of how Next.js works at a basic level including API routesm layouts components

The pages fetch content from a Sanity CMS api. This allows the site's users and authors to edit content and products that are available on the site.

All the styles for this site were done using plain css with variables. I chose this method to further my understanding of Vanilla css.
