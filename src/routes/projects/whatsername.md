## Technologies

This site is built using Next.js with Tailwind for styles. I chose this as it is a widely used SSG with lots of documentation and a great community that is able to offer help. I enjoy using Tailwind for style as it greatly improves my development speed by being able to quickly apply utility classes.

The pages fetch content from a Sanity CMS api. This allows the site's users and authors to edit content and products that are available on the site.

I have utilised Stripe and React Context to create a custom payment flow that then sends the customer a confirmation email and the site owners an email with the order information.
