# Platforms
I plan to release this game on as many devices as possible. Starting with consoles and PC, which as the game is a 2D platformer should mean it will run on most if not all modern gaming consoles and PC's, the game should also be released for macOS as it should include as many players as possible.

I would also like to release for mobile devices like phones and tablets, this will increase my target audience by a lot, the reason this is a separate goal from the standard release is incase I run into any issues with the playability or performance of the game on mobile devices.
