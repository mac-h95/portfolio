## Details
Abrasion will feature a large interconnected map akin to games like Hollow Knight, this design favours exploration and conveys a sense of progression by locking areas until the player has found skills or items that will help them through that obstacle. This is a very rewarding system.

## Outline
To start with I will create an outline of the map, with each room connected by a door, slope or tunnel system. I will also add icons displaying key areas and items such as boss fights and skills that will help the player through a section.

# Key Points
I need to ensure that the player is guided invisibly through the levels, for example if a player has just found an item to help them through an obstacle the path should naturally lead them back in that direction. A good timeline is key to a fun progression throughout the game.

It is important to ensure that all rooms feel unique and more importantly that each zone feels very different from the last.

The terrain should blend nicely between sections, for example if you have a tunnel system going from the cave section to the lava section, reflect this in the environment with more cracks in the rocks and heat lines starting to show. You can also do this from a water section to a grass section showing the ground getting wetter.

Ensure that the rooms adapt to the players new abilities, there is no point having a room with a wall jump that can be double jumped up, if you give the player a new ability then make sure they need to use it.
