# HUD
## Health
The health will be stored as teeth, starting the game with 3 teeth. Upon taking a hit the tooth will crumble and fall out of the container, leaving an outline in its place. I have chosen this method over a health bar as it gives the player immediate feedback on how much damage they can take.

## Mirrors
Mirrors are a collectible currency and will be displayed as an integer with an icon next to them. This should be hidden unless you pick up some mirrors or are in a shop.

> [!QUESTION] Animated mirrors?
> Should the mirrors fly up towards the UI on pickup?

# Map
The user will be able to press the <kbd>Select</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbd> button to bring up a map of the game, displaying sections they have previously visited. I considered adding a minmap in the top right similar to Hollow Knight however I prefer the more cinematic views with a very minimal user interface as seen in Ori.

# Title Screen
Should be either non existant and jump straight to the menu or should have a nice screen with a large title and just a press <kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>X</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd> dependant on system.

---

# Main Menu
The main menu should have a large title and a menu with minimal options:
	- Start Game
	- Options
	- Quit Game

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure all menu items on this and all other menus have nice spacing between each option.

---

# Pause Menu
The pause menu should darken the game screen, with a minimal centered container with rounded corners, this container should contain a title with the word Pause at the top of the game the options:
	- Resume Button
	- Save/Load
	- Settings
		- Resolution
		- Full Screen
		- Volume Mixer
		- Controls
	- Main Menu
	- Quit Game

# Fonts
What font should I use for the game? What kind of font would fit this game? A simple sans-serif font, most similar to Ori of the games on the Moodboard.

---

# Colors
What's a good color scheme for the design? Build the UI in noir colors first and then add a small amount of color to accent options.

Vibrant blues for accents. Possibly a gradient to a pink or purple for certain backgrounds (see Celeste stat screen).
