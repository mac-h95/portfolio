If you're reading this, you are already on my new site. I'd have a quick look around and see what sort of things I have done with it.

## Svelte

I chose to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) which, was recently picked up by [Vercel](https://vercel.com), my reasons for choosing it was how well svelte it is, the files are sleek with your styles, scripts and, template all living within a `.svelte` file which makes for incredibly streamlined components that are quick to manage.

A benefit of Svelte is that it compiles down to HTML, CSS, and JS during the build step, which means there is no client-side rendering, resulting in an incredibly performant app-like feeling on all websites.

## Tailwind CSS

I learned about Tailwind a few years back. I chose it due to the simple theming within the `tailwind.config.js` file. I also enjoy how quickly you can prototype new components. Despite some people claiming that it results in messy code, I found the development speed worthwhile.

## Markdown

Thanks to the lovely [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io) package, writing posts and project pages within Markdown is dreamlike. Those familiar with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) know how convenient it is to write with, mdsvex takes minimal setup, it also allows custom layouts nested within your main page.

## Google Lighthouse Scores

Here is a little screenshot detailing how this website scores on Lighthouse, Google's website page quality tool.
