## Technologies

I built this site using React, I chose this as I am most familiar with Next.js which is built as a Server Side Rendering layer on top of React, building this application helped me further my understanding of the library Next is built on top of.

All styles were done with vanilla css as I wanted to keep the app simple. Data fetching was achieved with SWR, this will allow the app to upscale if I choose as you can mutate data quickly and allows you to fetch from the cache first allowing extra quick loading.
